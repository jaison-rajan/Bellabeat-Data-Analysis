For users who want to improve their sleep, ***a new feature can be added to bellabeat app that allows users to enter the time that they would need to wake up the next day. Based on their input, the app would calculate and inform them when they should prepare to sleep***. This would allow users to recognize how much sleep they have been receiving and ways to change that.\n\nFrom the 3rd and 4th viz , there is a significant rise in calories burned and the steps took by users from 5:00 AM to all the way to 7:00 PM. But there is a dip in calories burned and steps took at 3:00 PM. This might be time were users are more tired and prefers to be less active.Also the calories burned and the steps took are almost consistent from 8:00 AM to 11: 00 AM.
